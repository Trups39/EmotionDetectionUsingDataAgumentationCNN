# EmotionDetectionUsingDataAgumentationCNN
The project explores Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for emotion detection. It covers training a model to analyze facial expressions, saving it, and real-time emotion analysis in videos with OpenCV. This hands-on approach demonstrates CNNs' role in computer vision for emotion recognition.
